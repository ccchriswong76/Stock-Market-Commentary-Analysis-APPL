My wave (a) target is 159. \\n\\r\\nThe solid black trajectory is my main path: \\n\\r\\n-Drop to 179-185 (targeting lower range) \\r\\n-Then bounce to 186-194 (targeting lower range) \\r\\n-Finally explosive drop to 159 (159 is only 0.5 retracement of the B wave, could go lower to 0.618 or 0.786 which would be 152, 140 respectively). Expecting 159 though to test breakout level from inverse head and shoulders that formed at base of B-wave. \\n\\r\\nTime to target in main path is end of August \\n\\r\\n------------------------------------- \\n\\r\\nThe dashed black path is my alt path: \\n\\r\\n-If we see bounce here around 183-186 then it would likely test low-mid 190s for resistance \\r\\n-Then drop to 173-177 \\r\\n-Then one more shallow bounce to 179-183 \\r\\n-Finally the explosive move down to 159 \\n\\r\\nTime to target in Alt path is end of Septemeber \\n\\r\\n-------------------------------------------------- \\n\\r\\nAfter Completion of (a) it will bein (b) of C and I will send an update there. \\n\\r\\nBest, \\r\\nTim Jobs \\n\\n\\n\\n\n",

Historic prices from as early 1988 to today were considered. Apple recently overtook UK's whole stock market cap. As one of the most important companies in the U.S. (more like in the world) its sole stock price may be a good indicator of the economy's health and world demand. The graph presented is bearish technically. Fundamentally, I believe the upcoming recession will be ruthless for stocks. Apple in particular, potentially losing more market value in relation to U.S. equities. My position arises from¬†America's recent political and economic instability, further projected problems - The changing of world order would see specifically U.S.'s core stocks lose value as quickly as they were gained through debt.\n",

AAPL is a major stock asset in the stock market with almost nearly $3 Billion in market-cap being the biggest market-cap stock within the stock market.  \\n\\r\\nIn my video I lift the secret behind the recent massive dump towards the downside and what should be considered with the dynamics in correlation with the levels that Apple approaches now. Apple is now in a crucial decisive movement with the bearish trend to either continue or reverse.  \\n\\r\\nWe will watch the symbol closely and cover any important changes in the dynamics. Especially within the next times and major changes within the market ongoing it will be an exciting dynamic when also considering a potential positioning in the market in the long- or short direction.  \\n\\nIn this manner, it will be greatly appreciated when you support my video. Have a good day and many lucks in trading.  \\n\\r\\nVP\\n                    \\n   \n",

Conversations with clients suggest that hedge funds are returning to token trading, with momentum strategies likely to benefit in part from heightened volatility due to lower trading volumes, the bank said.

If this bearish pattern is broken, the downside targets for APPL are T1 160 which is 50 days MA, and T2 150 where BigRed aka 200 days SMA. On this level there could be only short-lived bounces.   \\n\\r\\nThere are substantial bearish divergences on both RSI and MACD signaling end of rise is near or here.  \\n\\r\\nAlso, AAPL stopped on the resistance line, a blue dotted line.  \\n\\r\\nAll this is enough for me to take 50% already on the short position and the rest of the position after it breaks the pattern. \\n\\r\\nWith proper risk management tools and stop loss in the right position this almost certainly wins the trade.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

Analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote that low market confidence, limited catalysts and outperformance year-to-date have kept the digital asset industry stuck in a trading range, while a challenging macro backdrop may limit digital asset upside. Conversations with clients suggest that hedge funds are returning to token trading, with momentum strategies likely to benefit in part from heightened volatility due to lower trading volumes, the bank said. The report added that traditional finance (TradFi) firms and tech firms continue to build blockchain applications, focusing on the tokenization of demand deposits, repo settlement, and bond issuance.   \n",

AAPL is a major stock asset in the stock market with almost nearly $3 Billion in market-cap being the biggest market-cap stock within the stock market.  \\n\\r\\nIn my video I lift the secret behind the recent massive dump towards the downside and what should be considered with the dynamics in correlation with the levels that Apple approaches now. Apple is now in a crucial decisive movement with the bearish trend to either continue or reverse.  \\n\\r\\nWe will watch the symbol closely and cover any important changes in the dynamics. Especially within the next times and major changes within the market ongoing it will be an exciting dynamic when also considering a potential positioning in the market in the long- or short direction.  \\n\\nIn this manner, it will be greatly appreciated when you support my video. Have a good day and many lucks in trading.  \\n\\r\\nVP\\n                    \\n   \n",
