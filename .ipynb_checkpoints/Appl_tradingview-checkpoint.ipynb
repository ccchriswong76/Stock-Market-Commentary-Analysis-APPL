Keep an eye out for new support at around $177.30. RSI and the big down-gap indicate a potential markup before plummeting down. When support breaks new price target is $157. The macro-environment makes this even more bearish but wait until bounce and retest on current support before getting in. \n",

It's a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. In general, a current ratio of 2 or higher is considered good, and anything lower than 2 is a cause for concern. \\n\\n\n",

If we start to see the RSI and PPO come down sharply from the Overbought zones and closer to the 50 levels, then we could confirm a safer Bearish Entry with the stop marginally above the HOP level and target the 0.382 and 0.618 Fibonacci Retraces below.\\n                    \\n\n",

The consensus earnings estimate was 1.44 per share on revenue of 92.94 billion. The company beat expectations by 3.40% while revenue fell 2.51% compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company said during its conference call it expects Q3 revenue to decline similarly to its Q2 decline, with revenue of 80.9 billion. \\n\\r\\nI'm posting this as short because AAPL is sitting at its delta neutral 2023 uptrend centerline. It's currently at a useless technical long or short setup heading into earnings on 8/3/23. I would wait to open a trade on AAPL long from the 190 green lower trendline or short from the upper 204 red trendline if the opportunity presents itself. The white centerline on 8/3/23 lines up with 197. With that said, the market can respond to AAPL earnings announcement in an unpredictable either way up, down or sideways. \\n\\r\\nAAPL options data: \\n\\r\\n8/4/23 expiry \\r\\nPut Volume Total 44,982 \\r\\nCall Volume Total 91,097 \\r\\nPut/Call Volume Ratio 0.49 \\r\\nPut Open Interest Total 212,392 \\r\\nCall Open Interest Total 245,474 \\r\\nPut/Call Open Interest Ratio 0.87 \\n\\r\\n8/18/23 expiry \\r\\nPut Volume Total11,794 \\r\\nCall Volume Total19,121 \\r\\nPut/Call Volume Ratio0.62 \\r\\nPut Open Interest Total385,110 \\r\\nCall Open Interest Total436,636 \\r\\nPut/Call Open Interest Ratio0.88 \\n\\r\\n9/15/23 expiry \\r\\nPut Volume Total 6,041 \\r\\nCall Volume Total 8,824 \\r\\nPut/Call Volume Ratio 0.68 \\r\\nPut Open Interest Total 480,430 \\r\\nCall Open Interest Total 479,471 \\r\\nPut/Call Open Interest Ratio 1.00 \\n\\n\\n\n",

For AAPL, failure to extend to 201 and 204 signals B wave has finished, and we will get confirmation that C wave has started with completion of wave (a) of C down.

Double top you might ask? Yes. Double tops can break just prior to, at, or just above the previous highs. \\n\\r\\nToo many people make the mistake of thinking a crossing of a line means something in of itself. It doesn't. The structure is way more important. in this case, it was a rising wedge. \\n\\r\\nWhile you guys are seeing this late, my subs saw this setup before the crack. But I feel it is a great setup to teach even if it is a bit late. \\n\\r\\nThis is obviously bad JUJU for the overall market as it stands right now.\n",

However wait for a fall back to a key level after trend continue to downtrend momentum, because overall structure breakout and continue to downtrend. You can see it high time frame momentum.

However wait for a fall back to a key level after trend continue to downtrend momentum, because overall structure breakout and continue to downtrend. You can see it high time frame momentum.

It's been very accurate thus far. If the chart continues to be accurate it looks like we might see a pullback to 61.8% retracement of the most recent impulse wave (to ~$165). I would exercise caution going long on AAPL here. After the pullback I see AAPL hitting a new ATH around ~$218. \\n\\n\\r\\nThis is not a financial advice. Always do your own due diligence. \\n\n",

AAPL is a major stock asset in the stock market with almost nearly $3 Billion in market-cap being the biggest market-cap stock within the stock market.  \\n\\r\\nIn my video I lift the secret behind the recent massive dump towards the downside and what should be considered with the dynamics in correlation with the levels that Apple approaches now. Apple is now in a crucial decisive movement with the bearish trend to either continue or reverse.  \\n\\r\\nWe will watch the symbol closely and cover any important changes in the dynamics. Especially within the next times and major changes within the market ongoing it will be an exciting dynamic when also considering a potential positioning in the market in the long- or short direction.  \\n\\nIn this manner, it will be greatly appreciated when you support my video. Have a good day and many lucks in trading.  \\n\\r\\nVP   \n",
